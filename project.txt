Deadline : End Of Day  10/02/2023

Using the following links fulfill the objectives below

Python Strings : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm 
In a file stringsexample.py give an example code of accessing values in strings
In the same file give an example code of updating values in strings

Python Numbers : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_numbers.htm
In a file numbersexample.py gives an example of a mathematical function.


       3.

Write a Python program that:
Takes two input values, a and b
If a is equal to b, print "a and b are equal"
If a is greater than b, print "a is greater than b"
If b is greater than a, print "b is greater than a"
Requirements
The input values should be integers
If the input values are not integers, the program should print "Invalid input".
4.

Problem Statement 1
Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and calculates their sum, difference,
product, and quotient (division).
The program should also check if the two numbers are equal or not. If the second number is 0,
 the program should print an error message saying "division by zero" and not perform the division
  operation.
Requirements
The input values should be integers
If the input values are not integers, the program should print "Invalid input".

DEADLINE : MONDAY 13/02/2023 : 11:00 AM
BONUS : EXTRA CHALLENGE
Problem Statement 2
Write a Python program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome. A palindrome
 is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.
Requirements
The input should be a string
The program should ignore spaces, punctuation, and case when checking if the string is a palindrome.
If the input is not a string, the program should print "Invalid input".
